# School DistrictAnalysis

## Overview
A school board member has asked for a detailed analysis of pass/fail metrics of high school (9th-12th grade) students in math and reading. The report includes standardized testing data of 39,170 students from 15 schools. Top five and bottom five perfoming schools were identified, pass/fail correlated by school spending per student, by size of school, and by school type (charter or district). Additionally, academic disonesity was suspected in the Thomas High School 9th scores, so the analysis completed excluding those scores.
